Network Monitor
===============

A Mac OS X internet connection monitor. It tells you whether your connection can reach the outside world or not.

To build, simply import in XCode (6.0+), run the build (make sure your build configurations generate product relative to the workspace like described [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-locations_preferences/Build/Build.html)) and then run the bash script 'create_dmg.sh'.

This application is only a nice UI for the idea of the script in https://gist.github.com/hugocorbucci/4430189. It provides a better user interface for users that are not savvy with terminal applications.
